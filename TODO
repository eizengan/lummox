- Shift structs to directories

- Make a call on organizational parallelism:
  - decision:
    - Prefer nesting
    - Prefer SDL names
    - Something in-between
  - strategies
    - all Core names mirror SDL names
    - module files mirror headers
    - modules use hook to install sdl methods on Core
    - modules usehook to install constants on Core
