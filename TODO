- typedefs for special ids?
  - joystick id
  - window id
- simulate failure-to-map returned enum (e.g. returns -99 when all enum values are positive)
  - apply findings to show_cursor
- figure out mouse state button macros https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetMouseState#remarks
- annotate returned pointers which should be freed, check string/strptr
- are structures packed correctly?
  - padding in some events
  - enum sizes - underlying type

- organizational parallelism caveats
  - modules for headers
  - files for module structs/unions/enums
  - no changes to names other than...
    - SDL_ prefixes removed
    - case based on ruby-side norms to avoid surprise
    - additional underscores for readability
    - keycode, keymod symbols because they're bad
